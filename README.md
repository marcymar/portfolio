## About
This updated portfolio includes links to my GitHub, resume and LinkedIn page, as well as my contact email and phone number.  On the portfolio page it includes my recent projects, descriptions and links to the GitHub repositories.   
    
## Demo
This application originally would not deploy properly on GitHub pages, as a work around I recorded myself doing a walkthrough of the website through localhost.  You can find a demonstration of this app [here](https://youtu.be/pE20Z1eSoI4)
        
## Questions
You can find me [on Github](https://github.com/marcymar) under the username: marcymar. 

You can also contact me at marcella@ash-photos.com with any questions.

#### recently updated to include LinkedIn and resume links, as well as `target="_blank"`s added to the portfolio links.
